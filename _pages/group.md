      <span class="description">The aim of my research is to fill hollow-core fibre with rubidium vapour in order to develop a platform for light - matter interactions which can be integrated with minimal loss to optical fibre networks. My research involves designing and fabricating fibre optimised for faster filling with rubidium, engineering techniques for filling the fibre, developing low-loss methods of integrating the fibre with conventional step-index fibre, as well as demonstrating light-matter interactions, such as electromagnetically induced transparency, within the filled fibre.</span>

      <span class="description">My research focus is understanding the manipulation of molecules on silicon surfaces. Using a scanning tunelling microscope (STM) I aim to control current-driven splitting of an individual atom from a bromobenzene molecule. This will improve understanding of the fundamental dynamics of breaking the bond. Furthermore, I aim to computationally model the surface/molecule system using density functional theory (DFT) to understand the interaction and how the STM itself may influence the molecule-surface system.</span>

      <span class="description">The goal of my research is to, using plasmonic nanoparticles, design and test systems for the control of alkali vapour pressure in light matter interaction systems. My research exploits the photothermal response of plasmonic nanoparticles to convert light into localised thermal energy. This promotes desorption of alkali atoms from their container walls, allowing for fine control of vapour density. Vapour density control is a valuable tool in utilising light matter interaction for phenomena such as coherent population trapping or electromagnetically induced transparency.</span>

      <span class="title">Dr Eric Lundgren, Postdoctoral Researcher</span>
      <span class="description">I obtained my PhD from UCL in 2023, working at the London Center for Nanotechnology. I researched precursor molecules for atomic bismuth doping in silicon using an STM, and the applications of precision doping of single bismuth atoms for quantum device fabrication. Before this, I completed an MSci in Natural Sciences (Condensed Matter Physics and Inorganic Chemistry) at UCL, and undertook internships at the LCN and at Chalmers University of Technology. I have now joined Bath University seeking to build upon my STM knowledge through molecular manipulation and STM luminescence measurements, bridging the gap between STM and optics.</span>

      <span class="description">Pieter obtained a BSc in Natural Sciences (Physics with Chemistry) from the University of Bath in 2021 and has also spent two years in Bristol undertaking particle physics research as part of the DUNE and SiD collaborations. He is excited to be back in Bath and to be combining the particle coding habits with the physics and chemistry while working with the STMs. He is aiming to establish coupled measurement of light emission and atomic manipulation, enhanced with spectroscopic and single-photon correlation capabilities.</span>

      <span class="description">I obtained my PhD in atomic manipulation with the scanning tunnelling microscope from the University of Bath in 2016. Following a short postdoctoral position in photonics, I joined the Department of Physics at the University of Bath as an independent Prize Fellow in 2018 and as a tenured Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in 2021. In 2022 I was part of the team awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Faraday Division Horizon Prize for the discovery of chiroptical harmonic scattering. My research interests include single molecule manipulation, quantum optics, advanced materials, and speciality optical fibres.</span>

      <span class="description">I joined the University of Bath in 2023 as a postdoctoral research associate to work on fibre-integrated technologies for next-generation mobile communications on a collaborative project with British Telecom. During my PhD, I worked on silicon photonics, in particular on the fabrication of rare-earth (erbium) doped silicon, silica-on-silicon substrates to build a planar waveguide platform for an integrated waveguide amplifier (EDWA) using Ultrafast Laser Plasma doping (ULPD) at the University of Leeds. I received my BSc and MSc degrees in physics from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. I have done several internships, working on micro pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) in CERN, Switzerland, in Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Kolkata, India and on multi crystalline silicon wafer solar cells in SERIS, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.</span>

## Facilities

We operate in two main laboratory rooms that are specific to our group. The Atomic Manipulation room is located in the 4W building, underneath the coffee shop and houses 2 room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs with state-of-the-art automation. The sample characterisation room is located in the main Physics building 3W and contains an optics bench, a multipurpose benchtop AFM, and a set-up for working with on-chip optical devices. We also have access to numerous shared facilities, that include a optical fibre fabrication tower, multiphoton microscope, TEM, SEM, and a nanofabricaiton facility.
